# To Dos

## High Priority

- Write description for TSwift page.
- Ensure all pages have link to original story (if applicable).

## Mid Priority
- Add "mapcourt" label under SVG map pin.
- Add a card pointing out that this site itself was developed by me.
- Fix filter buttons' focus behavior on mobile.
    - Filter button text shows up blue on mobile. Fix that.
- Change color so color bar isn't weird on mobile.
- Add HDI social media graphics.
- Add articles written for HDI.
- Go page by page and add content descriptions if not already there.

- Add a console.log error if an image doesn't have alt text.
- Expand About Me section.

## Lower Priority
- Make the map pin clickable but not entire nav bar section.
- Proofread data design manifesto.
- Go card by card to copy edit "publication" and "type" values.
- Squoosh thumbnail images.
- Refactor Svelte code for filtered vs. unfiltered cards in Gallery.svelte. (Right now, if you update anything that gets passed to Card, you have to do it in both places.)

- Copy edit all content descriptions.
- Add Jersey map.
- Add powerbrokers story.
- Add China coldwar charts.
